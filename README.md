# KeyInterviewer

An automated way to provide easy-access interviewing practice for everyone

## The Project

One of the biggest challenges a student will come across in their time at University is applying for jobs- and the relentless preparation for interviews.

Not everyone will have the opportunity to practice interviews live with their friends or a career advisor- and that's where KeyInterviewer comes in. We want to help automate the process and provide fast and readily available feedback for students looking for help in their interviews.

The idea is simple: you log in, and do a mock interview [either typed, video or audio], as the app records what you do. When you've finished, the data that's been recorded is analysed with the help of GCP to obtain:

- Emotions and facial expressions from audio
- Spelling mistakes and sentiment from the text you've typed
- Sentiment from your audio 

## Running the project

- Ensure you have Python Flask installed
- Clone this repo and enter "python app.py" in your terminal

Everything complex is handled by use of GCP, so this is all you need to do to run the app locally.
